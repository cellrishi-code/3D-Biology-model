Biological Cell Signaling Simulation — MATLAB (2D + 3D Multiscale Model)

A comprehensive MATLAB simulation integrating:

⚡ Hodgkin–Huxley action potential dynamics (membrane voltage, ion channel gates, conductances, noise)

🧬 Li–Rinzel calcium oscillation model (cytosolic & ER Ca²⁺ dynamics)

🔬 Receptor–ligand binding kinetics (kon/koff occupancy landscape)

🌊 2D spatial calcium wave propagation (40×40 cell grid diffusion)

🚀 1D axon cable propagation with full Hodgkin–Huxley dynamics

📊 Advanced 2D & 3D scientific visualizations including phase space trajectories, conductance torus, receptor landscape, and full cell-state cloud

This project combines classical biophysical models inspired by the foundational work of Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley into a unified multiscale computational framework.

Designed for computational neuroscience, dynamical systems research, and scientific visualization exploration.
